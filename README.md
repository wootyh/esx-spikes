# esx-spikes
This was originally a QBCore script. I really liked it so I took time to convert it to ESX. Nothing speical. The orignal QBCore verison is linked at the bottom of this README. Uses `bt-target` since I don't use `ox_target`. The video linked is the QBCore verison. It works the same exact way. Enjoy!

This is the item table I use in `ox_inventory/data/items.lua`:                                                                                                           
`	['spikestrip'] = {
		label = 'Spikestrip',
		weight = 500,
		stack = false,
		close = true,
		description = 'A spikestrip used to pop tires, wow such pop much amaze.',
	},  `
